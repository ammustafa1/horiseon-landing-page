# horiseon-landing-page

Launched: https://ammustafa1.github.io/horiseon-landing-page/

HoriSEOn is a hypothetical search engine optimization company that I refactored the landing page for. 

This project was a very simple code refactor in which I refactored thh HTML and CSS files to be more concise. I added comments to the HTML file to ensure that the file remained organized and easily readable. Additionally I was able to shorten the CSS file without losing out on functionality by grouping CSS classes that followed the same rules.
